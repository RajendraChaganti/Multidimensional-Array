# C++ Matrix Manipulations

## Aim: To study and implement different matrix operations in C++.

## Tools: GNU g++ compiler (for local execution), Any code editor or an Online C++ Compiler.

# Theory:

Matrices are two-dimensional arrays and are widely used in mathematics and computer science for storing and manipulating data. Common matrix operations include displaying the matrix, matrix addition, matrix multiplication, finding the sum of diagonal elements, and finding the transpose of a matrix. These operations help in understanding data storage, iteration over multi-dimensional arrays, and basic linear algebra concepts in programming.

## Exp-8A: Displaying a Matrix

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program.
2. Input the number of rows and columns.
3. Declare a 2D array (matrix) with given size.
4. Input elements of the matrix.
5. Use nested loops to print the matrix.
6. End the program.

## Exp-8B: Addition of Two Matrices

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program.
2. Declare two 2x2 matrices `a` and `b`.
3. Input elements for both matrices.
4. Use nested loops to add corresponding elements and store in a result matrix `sum`.
5. Print the resulting sum matrix.
6. End the program.

## Exp-8C: Multiplication of Two Matrices

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program.
2. Declare two 2x2 matrices `a` and `b`.
3. Input elements for both matrices.
4. Use triple nested loops to calculate the product matrix `c`.
5. Print the product matrix.
6. End the program.

## Exp-8D: Sum of Main Diagonal Elements of a Matrix

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program.
2. Declare a 2x2 matrix `a`.
3. Input elements of the matrix.
4. Use a loop to sum the elements where row index equals column index.
5. Print the sum of the main diagonal.
6. End the program.

## Exp-8E: Transpose of a Matrix

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program.
2. Input the number of rows and columns.
3. Declare a matrix and a transpose matrix.
4. Input elements of the matrix.
5. Use nested loops to assign `transpose[j][i] = matrix[i][j]`.
6. Print the transpose matrix.
7. End the program.

## Conclusion:

This lab helped to understand the manipulation of 2D arrays (matrices) in C++ and implement important operations such as displaying a matrix, addition, multiplication, sum of diagonal elements, and transpose of matrices. Mastery of these operations builds a strong foundation for further studies in algorithms and linear algebra applications in programming.
